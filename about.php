                <p></p>
                <p>The restaurant’s continued viability relies on reservations being honoured by our customers, and adequate notice being given of any changes or cancellations.Accordingly, the following applies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We reserve the right to charge a cancellation fee for any booking that is cancelled, or if numbers are reduced without prior notice.</li>
                    <li>For all bookings, you must notify us of a cancellation or any changes to the number of guests at least 24 hours prior to your booking.</li>
                    <li>Christie’s Bistro reserves the right to charge a cancellation fee of £15 per person for any bookings changed or cancelled within this 24 hour notice period.</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>The cancellation fee reflects the cost incurred by Christie’s in terms of staffing, food, and any lost revenue as a result of turning away other potential bookings.</li>
                    <li>We will notify you if any cancellation fee is applied.</li>
                    <li> Any bookings which fail to turn up without any prior notice, will also incur a 500rs per person fee</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <h3 style="background-color: #757574da;">Restaurant Booking Policy</h3>
                <p></p>
                <p>The restaurant at Christie’s Bistro is open for lunch between 12pm and 3pm, Monday to Friday. We can seat up to 36 guests
                    during lunch but we are only able to accommodate so many guests within each half hour period in order to ensure that you
                    receive the best level of service from us, and we do ask that once you have secured a reservation at a particular time that
                    you adhere to that time.</p>
                <p>We strongly recommended that groups reserve a table in advance by contacting the team directly on our contact page.</p>
                <p>If a reservation is made then the table is yours for the whole of service and we do not normally ask you to vacate a table.</p>
                <p>However, should you arrive more than 30 minutes after your booking time without forewarning, then you may lose your
                    table to another group.</p>
                <p>We would respectfully ask that you are ready to be seated at the time of your reservation. Should you arrive after your
                    booking time, we may need to hold you back to a later time to ensure the best possible level of service to all our guests.</p>
                <p>It is essential that we are notified of any specific dietary requirements prior to your visit to ensure that we can cater for you
                    appropriately. If you have not informed us at the point of booking, please contact the restaurant to discuss your
                    requirements with a member of our team.</p>
                <p>Tables are allocated on the day by the restaurant team and although we will do everything we can to allocate a table in your
                    preferred area of the dining room, we cannot always guarantee this.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Any bookings paying on a University account must provide the correct account code at the time of booking or in
                        advance of coming to the restaurant.</li>
                    <li>For all charges to university accounts, an expenses form must be completed and signed at the time of the booking,

                    <li>We trust that the correct account code is provided for the booking and that the budget holder is aware of the costs
                        associated with the booking. We accept no responsibility for charges against the wrong cost code which has been
                        provided.</li>
                    <li>Failure to provide an activity code in advance or at the time of the booking will result in an alternative method of

                    <li>All other standard methods of payments are accepted, including American Express and ApplePay.</li>
                    <li>For all bookings, failure to notify us of a cancellation or any change to the number of guests at least 24 hours prior
